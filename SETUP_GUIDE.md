## 1️⃣ ADDING YOUR LOGO

### Step 1: Locate Your Logo File

You mentioned your logo is named: **`dragon_logo.png`**

### Step 2: Place the Logo in the Correct Folder

**Copy your logo to this exact location:**

```
C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\ReactProjects\redragon-colombo\frontend\public\images\logo\dragon_logo.png
```

**Path breakdown:**

```
frontend/
  └── public/
      └── images/
          └── logo/              👈 PUT YOUR LOGO HERE
              └── dragon_logo.png
```

### Step 3: Verify Logo Placement

After placing the logo, your folder should look like this:

```
frontend/public/images/
├── logo/
│   └── dragon_logo.png     ✅ Your logo
├── products/                   (empty for now)
├── banners/                    (empty for now)
└── icons/                      (empty for now)
```

**The logo is already referenced in the code** at:

- `frontend/src/components/Navbar.js` (Line 59)
- `frontend/src/components/Footer.js` (Line 55)

So once you place it in the folder, it will automatically appear!

## 2️⃣ RUNNING THE PROJECT

### Prerequisites

Make sure these are installed:

- ✅ Node.js (v14 or higher)
- ✅ npm (comes with Node.js)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Option A: Run ONLY Frontend (Design Phase - Recommended for Now)

Open terminal in project folder and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**What happens:**

- React development server starts
- Browser opens automatically at `http://localhost:3000`
- You'll see the **complete landing page** with:
  - Navbar with your logo
  - Hero banner (red gradient)
  - Product categories
  - Featured products (demo data)
  - Footer

**Hot reload is enabled** - Any changes you make to code will auto-refresh!

---

#### Option B: Run Backend + Frontend (Full Stack)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Note:** You don't need the backend yet since we're using static demo data.
